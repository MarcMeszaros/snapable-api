# File Server Backend
# Salt supports a modular fileserver backend system, this system allows
# the salt master to link directly to third party systems to gather and
# manage the files available to minions. Multiple backends can be
# configured and will be searched for the requested file in the order in which
# they are defined here. The default setting only enables the standard backend
# "roots" which uses the "file_roots" option.
#
# To use multiple backends list them in the order they are searched:
#
fileserver_backend:
  - roots
  - git

file_roots:
  base:
    - /vagrant/salt/file

# Git fileserver backend configuration
# When using the git fileserver backend at least one git remote needs to be
# defined. The user running the salt master will need read access to the repo.
#
gitfs_remotes:
  - git@bitbucket.org:snapable/salt-states.git

#####         Pillar settings        #####
##########################################
# Salt Pillars allow for the building of global data that can be made selectively
# available to different minions based on minion grain filtering. The Salt
# Pillar is laid out in the same fashion as the file server, with environments,
# a top file and sls files. However, pillar data does not need to be in the
# highstate format, and is generally just key/value pairs.

pillar_roots:
  base:
    - /vagrant/salt/pillar

#ext_pillar:
#  - hiera: /etc/hiera.yaml
#  - cmd_yaml: cat /etc/salt/yaml
