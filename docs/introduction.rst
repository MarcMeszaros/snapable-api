Introduction
============

The Snapable REST :term:`API` allows developers the ability to use the Snapable 
backend to collect and store images without being required to develop and maintain 
all the various technologies to collect and store the data. With the :term:`API`, 
developers can have photos collected via the official iOS and Android apps and 
display the photos inside their own web application.


**Development**

The API has been designed to be as simple as possible, but still give access to
all required parts necessary for developers to make a great web app powered by 
Snapable. We shall continue to improve the API and related documentation and tools
over time, so make sure to check back here often.

**Caveats**

The Snapable :term:`API` is relatively new and may have issues we haven't discovered 
yet. If you find an issue with the :term:`API` (or have any feedback regarding the API)
please `let us know <mailto:team@snapable.com>`_.
