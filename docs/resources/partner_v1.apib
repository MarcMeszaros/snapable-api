# Snapable Partner API (v1)
The partner API gives developers access to the Snapable backend allowing them
to create events and accounts from their own application.

To get more information about getting an API key, please contact us.

# Group Accounts
The account resource is the root resource that all others lead back to. An 
account is automatically created when a user resource is created. In most cases, 
you don't need to worry about the account. It is included since more features 
may be added to it in the future.

# Delete Event [DELETE]
Deletes the specified event and related data (photos, guests, etc.).

+ Response 204

# Group Guests
An *event* typically has many guests. Information about guests is used throught Snapable
to provide context. When a photo is taken, and the guest 
has opted to provide basic information, this information can be displayed with the
photo. An example would be to provide the guest name to give them credit for the
photo.

A guest should only be able to upload photos and should not be able to delete photos
or edit event details.

# Group Locations
The event location is optional but highly recommended. It is required for advanced
features such as the "Nearby Events" on the mobile apps. It simply contains a
human readable address and lat/lng coordinate (used by the mobile apps).

# Group Photos
A *photo* resource is the most important resource of the Snapable API and also the
most complex. The photo resource contains both metadata (ie. timestamp, guest that took
the photo, event it belongs to, etc.) as well as the actual photo data.

Photos are currently stored as JPEG. You can request various sizes from the API
with an optional size parameter.

# Group Users
A user belongs to an account and is what is considered the *event organizer*. Users
should be the only ones deleting photos and modifying event details.
